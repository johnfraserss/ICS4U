Rubric(s)
---------
How to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_A1_, _A2_, _A3_, and _A4_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _A1.1_, _A1.3_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _A1.1_, _A1.3_, and _A1.5_ will be used to generate a level for section _A1_. and so on through the various sections.
  * All subsections from **04a, 04b, 04c,** and **04d** will also be used to help generate a mark for this section.

| ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| **A1: Use different data types and expressions**  | | | | | |
| A1.1: Use the mod operator (%) |      |      |      |      |      |
| A1.2: Convert between different types of information (i.e. string-to-integer, string-to-characters, etc.)  | | | | | |
| A1.3: Demonstrate the ability to use non-numeric comparisons  | | | | | |
| A1.5: Use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types in a computer program  | | | | | |
| **A3: Design and write algorithms and subprograms to solve a problem**  | | | | | |
| A3.1: Demonstrate the ability to read from an external file or API  | | | | | |
| A3.3: Create functions to _insert_ and _delete_ array elements  | | | | | |
| **A4: Use proper code maintenance and documentation techniques**  | | | | | |
| A4.1: Work independently using support documentation  | | | | | |
| A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
