Presentation order was chosen randomly by placing all names (excluding mine) in a list and running them through [this](https://www.random.org/lists/) website 5 times.

If you know ahead of time that a date conflicts with something, please let me know as soon as possible.  
If you wish to change timeslots, you will have to find someone to swap with yourself.  Once the two of you have agreed upon a swap, let your teacher know so that he can switch names in this list.
