Task(s)
-------
1. Prove you understand objects in P5js.  Do **not** use work from Grade 11 or from last semester's class to prove your understanding.
2. To prove your understanding, create a program that displays an animated visual that is themed as one of the following: **_Earth_**, **_Air_**, **_Fire_**, or **_Water_**.
3. Document your work properly.
4. Resources below might prove useful.
   * [Objects in p5js - Example](https://p5js.org/examples)
  
_Note:_ In P5.js, there are two ways of creating objects.  Either using a _constructor function_ style or a JSON style.  We will revisit the world of JSON in a later topic (03c), but we will be using the _constructor function_ style frequently in the class as well.  You will want to be familiar with both.

Submission Item(s)
------------------
Submit your work into the **02d** folder of your repository.  
Modify the _README.md_ file in the **02d** folder to explain what your program does.

Due Date(s)
-------------
To be uploaded to the repository by 11:59pm on March 8th, 2017  
_**There will be a functions and objects test on March 9th, 2017 in class to ensure understanding**_
