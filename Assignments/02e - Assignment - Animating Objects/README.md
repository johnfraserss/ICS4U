Task(s)
-------
1. Create a program that proves you understand the following concepts:
   * Objects
   * HTML and DOM usage
   * Perlin Noise
   * Functions and Documentation
2. Your program must have **objects** moving around the screen.
3. Your program cannot resemble the work from sections **02a, 02b, 02c,** or **02d**.  This must be a new program.
4. Document your work. 

Submission Item(s)
------------------
Submit your work into the **02e** folder of your repository.  
Modify the _README.md_ file in the **02e** folder to explain what your program 

Due Date(s)
-------------
To be uploaded to the repository by 11:59pm on March 29th, 2017

Rubric(s)
---------
How to read the rubric below:
* The overall sections (_A1_, _A2_, _A3_, and _A4_) will be used to generate a mark
* The subsections (e.g. _A1.1_, _A1.2_, etc.) will be used to assess your understanding of the overall sections.
  * For example, _A1.1_, _A1.2_, _A1.3_, and _A1.4_ will be used to generate a level for section _A1_. and so on through the various sections.
  * All subsections from **02a, 02b, 02c,** and **02d** will also be used to help generate a mark for this section.

| | R | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|---| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**A1: Use different data types and expressions** |      |      |      |      |      |
|A1.1: Use the mod operator (%) |      |      |      |      |      |
|A1.5: Use an array of objects |      |      |      |      |      |
|**A2: Use modular programming concepts and principles (objects, files, functions, etc.)** |      |      |      |      |      |
|A2.1: Create a modular program that is divided among multiple files (classes in separate files)  | | | | | |
|A2.2: Use modular design concepts that support reusable code (i.e. encapsulation, functions, etc.)  | | | | | |
|**A3: Design and write algorithms and subprograms to solve a problem** |      |      |      |      |      |
|A3.3: Create a function to add items to an array  |      |      |      |      |      |
|**A4: Use proper code maintenance and documentation techniques** |      |      |      |      |      |
|A4.1: Work independently, using support documentation to resolve syntax issues during software development  | | | | | |
|A4.3: Create fully documented (and well-named) program code according to industry standards (**javadocs/jsdocs**, block comments, line comments, variable names, etc.)  | | | | | |

The final mark for this assignment will be calculated as: __Mark = R * C__ where **R = Rubric total** and **C = Completed the task as requested/described (worth 0 or 1)**
