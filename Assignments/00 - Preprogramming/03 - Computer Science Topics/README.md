Topic Break-down
--------
#### Environmental (Min: 200 words, Max: 300 words)
How can _you_ use computers and related technology _today_ to reduce the environmental impact of yourself, your home, your community, and even possibly the world.  Ensure that you choose actionable items that you can _actually_ start doing, other than the basic of things like _turn off lights_, _recycle more_, _use less paper_, etc.

#### Ethics (Min: 70 characters, Max: 100 characters, including spaces.)
Create a headline for a newspaper/blog/news-related site that would entice people to read an article where the content was about strategies to encourage ethical computing practices in your community, and in the workplace.

#### Emerging Technology (Min: 100 words, Max: 200 words)
Explain the impact of one emerging technology on members of society around the world, and on 
the economy.  Choose from _one_ of the following options: Embodied Avatars, Fabric-embedded screens, Computational Photography, Artificial Photosynthesis, Vertical Farming, Programmable Matter, Arcologies, Telepresence, Exocortex, Nanomedicine, Machine-augmented Cognition

#### Collaborative Research (Min: 100 words, Max: 200 words)
Report on _one_ of the areas of collaborative research between computer science and other fields: CS with Biology (excluding nanomedicine), CS with Geology (excluding GPS), CS with Health Informatics, CS with Sociology, CS with Art (excluding animation), or CS with Climatology

#### Theoretical Computer Science (Min: 125 words, Max: 150 words).
Investigate and explain on _one_ of the following in theoretical computer science areas: Computability Theory, Automata Theory, Image Processing, Natural Systems Simulations, Neural Networking in Computers.

Cite sources at the end.  Source, titles, and your name will **not** count towards your word/character limits.

Submissables
------------
Format your work using Markdown (not Word). Your work must be submitted in a .md file format.
