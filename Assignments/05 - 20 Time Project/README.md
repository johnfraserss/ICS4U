Task(s)
-------
1. Complete a project of your choosing based on the criteria below.
2. Present your project.
3. Complete a reflection of the whole process.



Project Criteria
--------
* Choose something you are passionate about.
* This project has to be new to you, and is something you won't get to do in another class (or this class).
* Decide what you will produce/showcase.
* Find an expert or an adult mentor.
* Must be shared with the world by the end.
* You must log your learning.  I suggest using a **geniushour** or **20time** Git repo that you update on a regular basis (minimum once a week).
* Failure is an option, the key is to learn from your mistakes!
