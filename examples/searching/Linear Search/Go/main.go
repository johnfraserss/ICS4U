/**
 * Linear search (a.k.a. the easier one)
 *
 * Time complexity: O(N)
 *   - slower at large scales
 *
 * Linear search is pretty self-descriptive.
 * Given an array, and an element X, loop through the entire
 * array in order until you find X.
 *
 * The benefit of linear search is that the array doesn't have to
 * be sorted since you're looping through the entire array.
