/**
 * Recursion
 *
 * Recursion is essentially just calling a function in itself until a certain
 * value or expected response is returned.
 *
 * In this example, we'll use factorials as an example.
 * Factorials (in case you weren't aware already) are mathematically represented by `N!`
 * where N is a positive integer, and ! is the factorial operator.
 *
 * Take `4!`, this is equal to 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, or 24
 *
 * So how do we implement this in code?

// Still confused? There's a lengthy explanation below

/**
 * Let's take the driver code/example there, finding the factorial of 4.
 *
 * We start off by passing 6 into `recursiveFactorial`, 6 !== 1,  so we pass
 * 4-1, which is 3, into recursiveFactorial, as well as the product, which is equal to 1*4, or just 4.
 * At N = 4:
 *    product = 4, N = 3
 *
 * `recursiveFactorial` is called again with the above parameters.
 * N !== 1, which means we pass N-1, which is 2, into `recursiveFactorial` with the product of
 * 4*3, which is 12.
 * At N = 3:
 *    product = 12, N = 2
 *
 * `recursiveFactorial` is called again with the above parameters.
 * N !== 1, which means we pass N-1, which is 1, into `recursiveFactorial` with the product of
 * 12*2, which is 24.
 * At N = 2:
 *    product = 24, N = 1
 *
 * `recursiveFactorial` is called again with the above parameters.
 * N === 1, which means we return the product, 24
 *
 * 24 === 4!
